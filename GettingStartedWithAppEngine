GETTING STARTED WITH APP ENGINE


Objectives

Initialize App Engine.

Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.

Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.

Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.

1. Activate Google Cloud Shell

  * To list the active account name with this command:

     $ gcloud config set account `ACCOUNT`
	
	
*To list the project ID with this command:
    gcloud config list project
	
	Result: 
	project = qwiklabs-gcp-00-2c01ef13f768
    Your active configuration is: [cloudshell-25060]
	
 2. Initialize App Engine
   
   *Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region:
     gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID gcloud compute set compute/zone us-central1-a
	 
   *Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:
     git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples
	 
   *Navigate to the source directory:
     cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world
	 
3.Run Hello World application locally

   * Download and update the packages list.
      sudo apt-get update
	  
   *Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application.
      sudo apt-get install virtualenv
	  
   *If prompted [Y/n], press Y and then Enter
   
   *Activate the virtual environment.
      source venv/bin/activate
	  
    *Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies.
	  pip install  -r requirements.txt
	  
    *To run the application:
	   python main.py
	   
	*To end the test
	  Ctrl+C 
	  
4. Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine

    *Navigate to the source directory:
	  cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world
	  
	*Deploy your Hello World application
	   gcloud app deploy
	   
	*If prompted "Do you want to continue (Y/n)?", press Y and then Enter.
	
	*Launch browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
	    gcloud app browse
		
	
5. Disable the application
     
	gcloud compute App engine --Settings "Disable application" --App ID "Disable"
